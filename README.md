# Portfolio-Developing
My name is Devildoesstuff but just call me Dare. (my discord is Devildoesstuff#8567 I have 3 year experience in HTML and C# programming. I have 3 year experience in Scripting Lua. I enjoy making backend systems but can work with upfront systems. I am 15 years of age. I am from the UK and am taking a Computer Science GCSE for Python and C# I have worked with others in the past.

Most of my games have been solo developed for experience so they are not meant to be played as full. But they demonstrate some of my most successful systems i have made.
